# Book Manuscript Development

## Overview

Use this skill to convert a book idea into a coherent, high-utility manuscript. Prioritize logical flow, clear reader progression, and practical examples over filler.

## Workflow

1. Lock audience, tone, and transformation goal.
2. Build scaffold first (outline and chapter intent).
3. Draft in sections with concrete examples and actionable takeaways.
4. Ensure each chapter bridges to the next.
5. Run a revision pass for clarity, readability, and practical density.

## Capability 1: Chapter-by-Chapter Outline (10-15 Chapters)

For each chapter include:
- Chapter title.
- 3-5 key points.
- Estimated word count (1500-3000).
- Reader transformation by chapter end.
- Connection to next chapter.

Required extras:
- Strong hook recommendation for chapter 1.
- Satisfying close recommendation for final chapter.

## Capability 2: Draft Full Chapter

When drafting chapter `N`, include:
- Opening hook.
- 3-4 main sections with subheadings.
- Concrete examples or mini case studies.
- Actionable takeaways.
- Transition sentence or paragraph to next chapter.

Defaults:
- Word count: 1500-3000.
- Voice: active.
- Avoid cliches and repetitive filler.

## Capability 3: Generate Illustrative Stories (8)

Each story:
- 150-250 words.
- Contains specific details and dialogue.
- Has beginning, middle, and end.

## Capability 4: Research and Fact Integration Pack

When user requests research for a chapter, produce:
- 10 credible statistics with sources.
- 5 expert quotes from recognized authorities.
- 3 recent studies supporting argument.
- 4 counterarguments with rebuttals.

Use table columns:
1. Data point.
2. Source.
3. Year.
4. Narrative support use.

## Capability 5: Exercises and Reader Application (12)

Exercise requirements:
- 10-20 minutes each.
- Step-by-step instructions.
- Completed example.
- Specific result or insight.

Mix exercise formats:
- Reflection question.
- Template.
- Checklist.
- Framework.
- Action plan.

## Capability 6: Transition Paragraphs Between Chapters

Given chapter summary X and X+1, write 3 transition options:
- 50-100 words each.
- End X with hook or cliffhanger.
- Create curiosity about next idea.
- Connect topics naturally.

## Capability 7: Detailed Case Studies (6)

For each case study include:
- Before state: person profile and pain points.
- Change: intervention, process, timeline.
- After state: measurable results and outcome.
- Lessons: 2-3 takeaways.

Diversity requirement:
- Vary age, background, starting point, and context.

## Capability 8: Final Book Conclusion

Include:
- 3-5 biggest insights (not chapter-by-chapter repetition).
- Reader future vision after applying content.
- Common barriers and practical mitigation.
- Next-step path.
- Memorable closing thought.

Default length:
- 600-1000 words.

## Capability 9: Chapter Review and Revision

## Quality Bar

- Keep prose active and specific.
- Ground claims with evidence where requested.

- Maintain reader transformation thread across chapters.

## Delivery Order

When multiple outputs are requested, use this order:
1. `Outline`
2. `Chapter Drafts`
3. `Stories and Case Studies`
4. `Research Table`
5. `Exercises`
6. `Transitions`
7. `Conclusion`
8. `Revision Notes`
